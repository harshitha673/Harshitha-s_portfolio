# Harshitha-s_portfolio
This project is a responsive and visually engaging personal portfolio website, developed using only HTML and CSS, to showcase my professional background, skills, and projects. It serves as a digital representation of my resume, enabling visitors to get a comprehensive overview of my educational qualifications, technical abilities, work experience, and contact detailsâ€”all in one place.

The goal behind creating this portfolio was to develop a clean and professional website that could reflect my personality and capabilities as a web developer and aspiring data analyst. Every section of this portfolio is thoughtfully structured, ensuring both clarity and ease of navigation.

ðŸ“Œ Sections Overview:
Home & Introduction
The landing page welcomes visitors with my name and professional title. It also includes a short introduction about me, giving users a quick glance into who I am and what I do. The use of CSS transitions adds subtle animations that enhance the user experience without affecting performance.

About Me
This section dives deeper into my background, including a summary of my passion for technology and interest in data analytics and software development. It helps build a personal connection with the user.

Education
Here, I have listed my academic background, including degree titles, institutions attended, years of study, and relevant academic achievements. The education details are presented in a table format for clean and structured viewing.

Skills
This section lists all the technical and soft skills I have acquired so far. It includes languages, tools, and technologies such as HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, Data Analysis tools, and more. The use of skill bars or badges highlights my proficiency levels in each area.

Projects
A key part of the portfolio, the Projects section showcases some of the notable work I have done, including mini-projects, academic assignments, and personal projects. Each project includes a brief description and the tools used. Hyperlinks are provided (if hosted on GitHub or live) for users to explore them further.

Work Experience / Internships
This section outlines any internships or work experience Iâ€™ve gained. It describes the roles I played, the technologies I worked with, and the key outcomes from each role.

Contact Information
I have included an easy-to-access contact section with phone number, email, and clickable icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, and Gmail. Visitors can quickly get in touch or view my social profiles. I also used mask icons and hover effects to enhance interactivity and design.

ðŸŽ¨ Design Highlights:
Dark blue background with contrasting white text for readability.

Interactive hover effects on the navigation bar.

Responsive design for compatibility with various screen sizes.

Table styling with border shadows, glowing effects, and rounded corners to give a modern look.

ðŸ’¡ Conclusion:
This project has helped me understand the power of structuring content using semantic HTML and styling it efficiently with CSS. It stands as a strong example of how core web development tools can be used to create a functional, aesthetic, and informative website without relying on frameworks.
